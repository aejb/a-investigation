# Session One
## Can Malusâ€™s law be verified experimentally?

### Procedure (Practical Method)

1. Set up the equipment with the white LED and two filters.
2. Turn on the mictrocotroller, and set the filters to a 0 degrees offset.
3. Record the initial intensity sensor value.
4. Change the angle between the two filters in steps of 5 degrees, and record the intensity sensor value at each offset interval, being careful not to misalign the sensor or LED.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until a sufficient number of repeats has been obtained to reduce the impact of anomalous results.
